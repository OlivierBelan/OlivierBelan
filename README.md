## Hi there 👋

### Originally from Paris, a Kent and Epitech graduate, I’m currently advancing my PhD in Artificial Intelligence at
the University of Kent, England. My research interests include NeuroEvolution, Spiking Neural Networks,
Neuromorphic Computing, and Reinforcement Learning, though I am always keen to expand my knowledge in
other areas. I am currently seeking an internship and would be happy to connect and collaborate on innovative
projects!
